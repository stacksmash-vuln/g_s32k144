    @brief How to trigger ADC by software

    ## Application description ##
    ______
    The purpose of this demo application is to show you the usage of the ADC module triggered by software from the S32K118 CPU using the S32 SDK API.

    - The application uses software to trigger ADC conversions every 1s.

    - When the conversion is complete the data is sent to the host PC using LPUART.

    ## Prerequisites ##
    ______
    To run the example you will need to have the following items:
    - 1 S32K118 board
    - 1 Power Adapter 12V (if the board cannot be powered from the USB port)
    - 1 Personal Computer
    - 1 Jlink Lite Debugger (optional, users can use Open SDA)
    - UART to USB converter if it is not included on the target board. (Please consult your boards documentation to check if UART-USB converter is present).

    ## Boards supported ##
    ______
    The following boards are supported by this application:
    - S32K118EVB-Q064

    ## Hardware Wiring ##
    ______

    The following connections must be done to for this example application to work:

    PIN FUNCTION            | S32K118EVB-Q064
    ------------------------|--------------------------------
    LPUART0 TX   (\b PTB1)  | UART_TX - wired on the board
    LPUART0 RX   (\b PTB0)  | UART_RX - wired on the board
    ADC0 Input 10 (\b PTC2) | Connect J2-1 - TP528 (\b POT)
    VDD selection           | Connect J10-1 - J10-2 (\b 3V3 selection)

    ## How to run ##
    ______

    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New -> \b S32DS \b Project \b From \bExample and select \b adc_swtrigger_s32k118. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    Wait for the S32 Configuration to be initialized and ready.

    #### 2. Generating the S32 configuration ####
    The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
    The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
    Left click on the current project, then click "Open S32 Configuration" (it has blue chip symbol on the top of the toolbar).
    In S32 Configuration menu, click on the desired configurator (Pins, Clock, Peripherals, etc.). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
    Pay attention to any error and warning message. If any configured value is invalid, they will be shown for user.
    Make the desired changes (if any) then click "Update Code".

    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be two debug configurations for this project:
     Configuration Name | Description
     -------------------|------------
     \b adc_swtrigger_s32k118_debug_flash_jlink | Debug the FLASH configuration using Segger Jlink debuggers
     \b adc_swtrigger_s32k118_debug_flash_pemicro | Debug the FLASH configuration using PEMicro debuggers
    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.

    @note The Debug_RAM configuration could not be accommodated for the current example, due to the small RAM footprint present on S32K116.
    @note For more detailed information related to S32 Design Studio usage please consult the available documentation.

    ## Notes ##
    ______

    For this example it is necessary to open a terminal emulator and configure it with:
    -   115200 baud
    -   One stop bit
    -   No parity
    -   No flow control
