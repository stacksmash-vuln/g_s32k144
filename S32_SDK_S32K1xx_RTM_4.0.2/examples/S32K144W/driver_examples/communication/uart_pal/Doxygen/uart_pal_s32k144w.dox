    @brief Basic application that presents the project scenarios for S32 SDK

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    The purpose of this demo is to show the user how UART PAL works over FLEXIO_UART or LPUART peripherals.
    The user can choose whether to use FLEXIO_UART or LPUART (see USE_FLEXIO_UART define from The board sends a welcome message to the console with further instructions.)
    - The welcome message is sent via UART: "This example is an simple echo using UART_PAL
                                             it will send back any character you send to it.
                                             The board will greet you if you send 'Hello!'
                                             Now you can begin typing:"
    - User shall send "Hello!" string. If the board receives the user's string, then the "Hello World!" string shall be sent again.
      User need to add EOL character to string which will be sent to board.
      Blue led(devkit) or led 1(Motherboard) shall be turned on if the communication is done over FLEXIO_UART; similarly the led shall be turned off if the communication is done over LPUART.

    ## Prerequisites ##
    _____
    To run the example you will need to have the following items:
    - 1 XS32K14WEVB-Q064 board
    - 1 Power Adapter 12V (if the board cannot be powered from the USB port)
    - 2 Dupont male to male cable
    - 1 Personal Computer
    - 1 PEmicro

    ## Boards supported ##

    ## How to run ##
    _____
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New -> \b S32DS \b Project \b From \bExample and select \b hello_world_s32k144w. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    Wait for the S32 Configuration was initialized and ready.

    #### 2. Generating the S32 configuration ####
    The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
    The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
    Left click on the current project, then click "Open S32 Configuration" (it has blue chip symbol on the top of the toolbar).
    In S32 Configuration menu, click on the desired configurator (Pins, Clock, Peripherals, etc.). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
    Pay attention to any error and warning message. If any configured value is invalid, they will be shown for user.
    Make the desired changes (if any) then click "Update Code".

    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b RAM (Debug_RAM) or \b FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be two debug configurations for this project:
     Configuration Name                                 | Description
     ---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
     \b uart_pal_s32k144w_debug_ram_pemicro             | Debug the RAM configuration using PEMicro debuggers
     \b uart_pal_s32k144w_debug_flash_pemicro           | Debug the FLASH configuration using PEMicro debuggers
    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.

    @note For more detailed information related to S32 Design Studio usage please consult the available documentation.

    ## Notes ##
    ______
    For this example it is necessary to open a terminal emulator and configure it with:
    -   9600 baud
    -   One stop bit
    -   No parity
    -   No flow control
    -   '\\n' line ending
